# Covid-19 Dashboard
This dashboard is developed using Plotly and Dash to show the Covid-19 information. It contains three plots. The first plot shows the trend of different parameters of covid cases around the world. The second plot shows the covid-19 details on the top 10 countries. The last plot shows the vaccinations report of all states in the USA. This app is deployed using Heroku.
